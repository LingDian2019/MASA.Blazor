## zh-CN

Tabs can be dynamically added and removed. This allows you to update to any number and the `MTabs` component will react. In this example when we add a new tab, we automatically change our model to match. As we add more tabs and overflow the container, the selected item will be automatically scrolled into view. Remove all `MTabs` and the slider will disappear.
