## Application
The m-app component and the app prop on components like m-navigation-drawer, m-app-bar, m-footer and more, help bootstrap your application with the proper sizing around <m-main> component. This allows you to create truly unique interfaces without the hassle of managing your layout sizing. The m-app component is REQUIRED for all applications. This is the mount point for many of components and functionality and ensures that it propagates the default application variant (dark/light) to children components and also ensures proper cross-browser support for certain click events in browsers like Safari. m-app should only be rendered within your application ONCE.
