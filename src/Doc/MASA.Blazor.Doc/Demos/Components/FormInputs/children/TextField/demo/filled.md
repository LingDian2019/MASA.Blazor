This is an example of the default application markup for Vuetify. You can place your layout elements anywhere, as long as you apply the app property. The key component in all of this is v-main. This will be dynamically sized depending upon the structure of your designated app components. You can use combinations of any or all of the above components including v-bottom-navigation.

When using vue-router it is recommended that you place your views inside v-main.
